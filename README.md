# Real-Time-Event-Detection-Using-Big-Data
Welcome to the Real-Time Event Detection Using Big Data project! This repository contains the implementation of a system designed to detect events in real-time by processing large-scale data streams. Leveraging big data technologies, this project aims to identify significant events (e.g., anomalies, trends, or specific occurrences) from continuous data feeds with low latency and high scalability.

The system is built to handle high-velocity data, making it suitable for applications such as social media monitoring, financial fraud detection, IoT sensor analysis, or real-time traffic event detection.
Features
Real-Time Processing: Processes data streams in real-time using scalable big data frameworks.
Event Detection: Identifies predefined or anomalous events based on configurable rules or machine learning models.
Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of data with distributed computing.
Modularity: Easily extensible to support different data sources and event types.
Visualization: Includes tools to visualize detected events in real-time (optional, depending on implementation).
Technologies Used
Apache Kafka: For real-time data ingestion and streaming.
Apache Spark: For distributed data processing and event detection.
Apache Flink: Alternative streaming engine for low-latency processing (if applicable).
Hadoop HDFS: For storing large datasets (optional).
Python: Core programming language for scripts and logic.
Machine Learning: Optional integration with libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow for advanced event detection.
Docker: For containerized deployment.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Java (version 8 or higher)
Python (version 3.8+)
Apache Kafka (version 2.8+)
Apache Spark (version 3.0+)
Docker (optional, for containerized setup)
Git (to clone the repository)
Installation

Clone the Repository:
https://github.com/pujitha242/Real-Time-Event-Detection-Using-Big-Data

Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Up Kafka:
Start Zookeeper: bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
Start Kafka Server: bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
Create a topic: bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
Configure Spark:
Ensure Spark is installed and added to your PATH.
Update config/spark-config.conf with your cluster settings.
