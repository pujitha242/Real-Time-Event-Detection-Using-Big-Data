# Real-Time-Event-Detection-Using-Big-Data
Welcome to the Real-Time Event Detection Using Big Data project! This repository contains the implementation of a system designed to detect events in real-time by processing large-scale data streams. Leveraging big data technologies, this project aims to identify significant events (e.g., anomalies, trends, or specific occurrences) from continuous data feeds with low latency and high scalability.

The system is built to handle high-velocity data, making it suitable for applications such as social media monitoring, financial fraud detection, IoT sensor analysis, or real-time traffic event detection.
